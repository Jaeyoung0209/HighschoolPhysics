# HighschoolPhysics
Dodging platformer game about physics made for a 2-week game jam
The game can be played online: https://j02.itch.io/highschool-physics

The entire game was made by me including the code, artwork, sound effects, background music, etc.

Overall Positives:
* The game concept is straightforward
* Mechanics is easy to understand
* Has a background music

Overall Negatives:
* Difficulty is too high -> Could've been fixed with enough playtesting
* Potential bug with the scoring system
* Needs better indication of what objects can be touched
